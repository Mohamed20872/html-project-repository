<h1>types of AI</h1>
<h2>Reactive AI</h2>
The most basic type of artificial intelligence is reactive AI, which is programmed to provide a predictable output based on the input it receives. Reactive machines always respond to identical situations in the exact same way every time, and they are not able to learn actions or conceive of past or future.

<h3>Examples of reactive AI include:</h3>

●    Deep Blue, the chess-playing IBM supercomputer that bested world champion Garry Kasparov

●    Spam filters for our email that keep promotions and phishing attempts out of our inboxes

●    The Netflix recommendation engine

Reactive AI was an enormous step forward in the history of artificial intelligence development, but these types of AIs can’t function beyond the tasks they were initially designed for. That makes them inherently limited and ripe for improvement. Scientists developed the next type of AI from this foundation.

<h2>Limited Memory AI</h2>
Limited memory AI learns from the past and builds experiential knowledge by observing actions or data. This type of AI uses historical, observational data in combination with pre-programmed information to make predictions and perform complex classification tasks. It is the most widely-used kind of AI today.

For example, autonomous vehicles use limited memory AI to observe other cars’ speed and direction, helping them “read the road” and adjust as needed. This process for understanding and interpreting incoming data makes them safer on the roads.

However, limited memory AI – as its name suggests – is still limited. The information that autonomous vehicles work with is fleeting, and it is not saved in the car’s long-term memory.

<h2>Theory of Mind AI</h2>
Want to hold a meaningful conversation with an emotionally intelligent robot that looks and sounds like a real human being? That’s on the horizon with theory of mind AI.

With this type of AI, machines will acquire true decision-making capabilities that are similar to humans. Machines with theory of mind AI will be able to understand and remember emotions, then adjust behavior based on those emotions as they interact with people.

There are still a number of hurdles to achieving theory of mind AI, because the process of shifting behavior based on rapidly shifting emotions is so fluid in human communication. It is difficult to mimic as we try to create more and more emotionally intelligent machines.

That said, we are making progress. The Kismet robot head, developed by Professor Cynthia Breazeal, could recognize emotional signals on human faces and replicate those emotions on its own face. Humanoid robot Sophia, developed by Hanson Robotics in Hong Kong, can recognize faces and respond to interactions with her own facial expressions.
