<h1>The Target of AI </h1>
<h2>How can Artificial Intelligence change our life (AI) </h2>
<p1>The major goals of artificial intelligence also correspond to the traditional problems AI research intends to solve, as well as to the subsets and specific fields of AI. These goals are knowledge reasoning, planning, machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and artificial general intelligence.

    <li>1. Knowledge Representation and Reasoning</li>

Knowledge representation and reasoning, also known as KR&R or KR, is a specific field within artificial intelligence focusing on designing and implementing computer representations that can process information about the world to solve complex problems.

As one of the major goals of AI, KR&R specifically aims to automate different kinds of reasoning. It involves the codification of factors or relationships between ideas, or rules or transitions between sets of facts in a manner that can be interpreted by a computer system.

Some of the applications of knowledge representation and reasoning include a computer-aided diagnosis for assisting physicians to interpret medical images, as well as a natural-language user interface that involves using human language as input for interacting with computers or software.

<li>2.Automated Planning and Scheduling</li>
Some times called AI planning, automated planning, and scheduling is another subset and field of artificial intelligence concerned with the automated generation of action sequences that correspond to strategies that can be executed by an AI system such as unmanned vehicles or autonomous robots.

As one of the traditional problems of AI research, AI planning aims to mechanize and automate the generation of a plan based on predetermined goals and objectives, and a set of possible actions. Note that it is also one of the fundamental abilities needed to increase the autonomy and flexibility of AI systems.

Examples of AI planning include self-correcting computer programs or software applications, robots that serve as autonomous agents, automated information gathering, and computer-aided suggestions.

<li>3. Machine Learning</li>

Machine learning is both a specific field of artificial intelligence and an actual application of AI. As a field of discipline, it involves the study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions effectively.

Central to the concept of machine learning is a different approach to computer programming. To be more specific, it involves the development and use of computer algorithms that can process and analyze Big Data and learn from the outcome without being explicitly programmed.

The benefits of machine learning include supplementing data mining, continuous improvements, and automation of tasks. Real-world applications include search engine ranking, content delivery, online advertising, autonomous driving, and intelligent assistant, among others.
